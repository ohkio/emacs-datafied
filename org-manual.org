** Introduction
*** Summary
    Nothing to practice
*** Installation
 Already installed wanna keep moving
*** Activation
**** Activate Org Mode
***** File Extension
      Any file that ends in '.org' will turn on org mode.
***** File Text                                                    :confused:
      Start a file of any extension with the following text
 #+BEGIN_SRC org
 MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-
 #+END_SRC
      Not able to get this to work, must need something else unspoken.
**** Suggested Key Bindings
***** .emacs addition
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'org-store-link)
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda)
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture)
 #+END_SRC
*** Feedback
**** Problems, Questions, Remarks, Ideas
***** email
      emacs-orgmode@gnu.org
***** mailing list
      [[https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode][mailing list]]
**** Bug Report
***** Componant Parts
****** Summary
       + emacs-version
       + org-version
       + org lines in emacs init file
****** Commands
       + M-x emacs-version <RET>
       + M-x org-version <RET>

 Everything at once:
 M-x org-submit-bug-report <RET>
**** Minimal mode                                                  :confused:
 I don't fully understand this yet, but minimal mode should have the following code
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 ;;; Minimal setup to load latest `org mode'.

 ;; Activation debugging.
 (setq debug-on-error t
       debug-on-signal nil
       debug-on-quit nil)

 ;; Add latest Org mode to load path.
 (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/listp"))
 (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t))
 #+END_SRC
 The paths to org-mode confuse me a little. And I'm not sure if there's a specific place I'm
 supposed to store this code. I'm supposed to start it like this:
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $emacs -Q -l /path/to/minimal-org.el
 #+END_SRC
**** Backtrace
 When encountering a bug do the following:
 1) Reload uncompiled versions of org mode. This helps make helpful backtrace
    C-u M-x org-reload <RET>
 2) Activate debugger
    M-x toggle-debug-on-error <RET>
 3) Recreate error
 4) Save backtrace buffer to file
    C-x C-w

***** Note                                                             :typo:
      Current: M-x toggle-debug-or-error <RET>
      Fixed:   M-x toggle-debug-on-error <RET>
*** Typesetting Conventions Used in this Manual
**** 'TODO' keywords
***** built in keywords
 All caps:
 TODO
 DONE
***** user defined
 still all caps:
 WAITING
 FOUND
 FIXED
**** tags
 case-sensitive
***** user defined
 should be all lower case:
 confused
 typo
***** built in tags
 use whatever is specified, usually all caps:
 ARCHIVE
**** property keywords
***** user defined
 Capitalized:
 Release
 Information
***** built in
 all caps:
 PRIORITY
 CUSTOM_ID
**** other keywords and blocks
 Normally written in upper case for "readability" but lower case still works:
 TITLE
 BEGIN...END
** Document Structure
*** Headlines
**** This
***** Is
****** An
******* Elaborate
****** Example
*** Visibility Cycling
**** Global and local cycling                                      :practice:
 [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Global-and-local-cycling.html#Global-and-local-cycling][cycling keys]]
 Basically use tab or shift tab or variations on tab to get the visibility you want
**** Initial visibility
     :PROPERTIES:
     :VISIBILITY: all
     :END:
 See the top of the file for an example of startup visibility. See the property for this header
 for more specific visibility. Hit
 C-u C-u TAB
 to go to main visibility
**** Catching invisible edits
*** Motion                                                         :practice:
 [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Motion.html#Motion][motion keys]]
 Nothing to write. Check manual
*** Structure Editing                                              :practice:
 [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html#Structure-Editing][structure editing keys]]
 All practice stuff no visuals check manual
*** Sparse Trees                                            :review:practice:
 This seems important but maybe after reading the rest of the manual
*** Plain Lists                                                    :practice:
 [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Plain-Lists.html#Plain-Lists][plain list keys]]
    - unordered
    - list
    - example :: with a description
      + different
      + header
	* different
	* again
	  1. Ordered
	  2. List
	  3. example
	     1) etc.
		a. etc.
		   A. etc.
		      a) etc.
			 A) etc.
*** Drawers                                                        :practice:

 [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Drawers.html#Drawers][Drawer keys]]
 Drawers hide information you don't always need to see
 :DRAWERNAME:
 Stuff you don't want to see in your drawer
 like socks
 and shirts
 :END:
 After the drawer
*** Blocks
 Blocks are like drawers but sometimes used for code and stuff
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 stuff in a block
 #+END_EXAMPLE
 Seems like it requires some kind of underscore. Not sure about specifics.

  - :wstart :: The starting day of the week. The default is 1 for Monday.
  - :mstart :: The starting day of the month. The default is 1 for the first.
  - :step :: Set to 'day', 'week', 'month', or 'year' to split the table into 
             chunks. To use this, either ':block', or ':tstart' and ':tend'
	     are required.

		  in this order.
  - :tags :: When this flat is non-nil, show the headline's tags.
  - :properties :: List of properties shown in the table. Each property gets
		   its own column.
  - :inherit-props :: When this flag is non-nil, the values for ':properties'
		      are inherited.
  - :formula :: Content of a 'TBLFM' keyword to be added and evaluated. As a
		special case, ':formula %' adds a column with % time. If you
		do not specify a formula here, any existing formula below the
		clock table survives updates and is evaluated

#+END_SRC
****** keys
       When in Capture template buffer, the key/s to type to get to this particular template

       When using several keys, keys using the same prefix key must be sequential in the list
       and preceded by a 2-element entry explaining the prefix key, for example
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("b" "Templates for making stuff to buy")
        ("bt" "buy toys" type target ...)
	("bo" "buy office supplies" type target ...)...)
#+END_SRC
****** description
       A short string describing the template, shown during selection.
****** type
       - entry :: An Org mode node, with a headline. Will be filled as the child of the target
		  entry or as a top-level entry. The target file should be an Org file.
       - item :: A plain list item, placed in the first plain list at the target location.
		 Again the target file should be an Org file.
       - checkitem :: A checkbox item. This only differs from the plain list item by the
		      default template
       - table-line :: A new line in the first table at the target location. Where exactly the
		       line will be inserted depends on the properties :prepend and 
		       :table-line-pos
       - plain :: Text to be inserted as it is.
****** target
       Specification of where the captured item should be placed. In Org files, targets
       usually define a node. Entries will become children of this node. Other times will be
       added to the table or list in the body of this node. Most target specifications
       contain a file name. If that file name is the empty string, it defaults to
       org-default-notes-file. A file can also be given as a variable or as a function called
       with no argument. When an absolute path is not specified for a target, it is taken as
       relative to org-directory.

       Valid values:
       - '(file "path/to/file")' :: Text will be placed at the beginning or end of that file
       - '(id "id of existing org entry")' :: Filing as child of this entry, or in the body 
            of the entry.
       - '(file+headline "filename" "node headline")' :: Fast configuration if the target
	    heading is unique in the file.
       - '(file+olp "filename" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)' :: For non-unique headings,
	    the full path is safer.
       - '(file+regexp "filename" "regexp to find location")' :: Use a regular expression to
	    position point
       - '(file+olp+datetree "filename" [ "Level 1 heading" ...])' :: This target creates a
	    heading in a date tree for today's date. If the optional outline path is given,
	    the tree will be built under the node it is pointing to, instead of at top level.
	    Check out the :time-prompt and :tree-type properties below for additional
	    options.
       - '(file+function "filename" function-finding-location)' :: A function to find the
	    right location in the file.
       - '(clock)' :: File to the entry that is currently being clocked.
       - '(function function-finding-location)' :: Most general way: write your own function
	    which poth visits the file and moves point to the right location
****** template
       The template for creating the capture item. Specifics in later section.
****** properties
       Additional but optional properties:
       - :prepend :: Normally new captured information will be appended at the target
		     location (last child, last table line, last list item, ...). Setting
		     this property changes that.
       - :immediate-finish :: When set, do not offer to edit the information, just file it
	    away immediately. This makes sense if the template only needs information that
	    can be added automatically.
       - :empty-lines :: Set this to the number of lines to insert before and after the new
			 item. Default 0, and the only other common value is 1.
       - :clock-in :: Start the clock in this item.
       - :clock-keep :: Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.
       - :clock-resume :: If starting the capture interrupted a clock, restart that clock
			  when finished with the capture. Note that :clock-keep has
			  precedence over :clock-resume. When setting both to non-nil, the
			  current clock will run and the previous one will not be resumed.
       - :time-prompt :: Prompt for a date/time to be used for date/week trees and when
			 filling the template. Without this property, capture uses the
			 current date and time. Even if this property has not been set,
			 you can force the same behavior by calling org-capture with a C-1
			 prefix argument.
       - :tree-type :: When wee, make a week tree instead of a month tree, i.e., place the
		       headings for each day under a heading with the current ISO week.
       - :unnarrowed :: Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the full buffer.
			Default is to narrow it so that you only see the new material.
       - :kill-buffer :: If the target file was not yet visited when capture was invoked,
			 kill the buffer again after capture is completed.
       - :no-save :: Do not save the target file after finishing the capture
******* Typo                                                           :typo:
	in :clock-resume definition I think :clock-keep should instead be :clock-in based
	on how the functionality is being described.
***** Template expansion
      "%-escapes" Expanded in the given order:
      - %[FILE] :: Insert the contest of the file given by FILE.
      - %(EXP) :: Evaluate Elips expression EXP and replace it with the result. The EXP form
		  must return a string. Only placeholders pre-existing within the template,
		  or introduced with %[file], are expanded this way. Since this happens
		  after expanding non-iterative "%-escapes", those can be used to fill the
		  expression.
      - %<FORMAT> :: The result of format-time-string on the FORMAT specification.
      - %t :: Timestamp, date only.
      - %T :: Timestamp, with date and time.
      - %u, %U :: Like %t, %T above, but inactive timestamps.
      - %i :: Initial content, the region when capture is called while the region is active.
	      If there is text before %i on the same line, such as indentation, and %i is
	      not inside a %(exp) form, that prefix is added before every line in the
	      inserted text.
      - %a :: Annotation, normally the link creaded with org-store-link.
      - %A :: Like %a, but prompt for the description part.
      - %l :: Like %a, but only insert the literal link.
      - %c :: Current kill ring head.
      - %x :: Content of the X clipboard
      - %k :: Title of the currently clocked task.
      - %K :: Link to the currently clocked task.
      - %n :: User name (taken from user-full-name)
      - %f :: File visited by current buffer when org-capture was called.
      - %F :: Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.
      - %:keyword :: Specific information for certain link types, see below.
      - %^g :: Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
      - %^G :: Prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.
      - %^t :: Like %t, but prompt for date. Similarly %^T, %^u, %^U. You may define a
	       prompt like %^{Birthday}t
      - %^C :: Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
      - %^L :: Like %^C, but insert as link.
      - %^{PROP}p :: Prompt the user for a value for property PROP
      - %^{PROMPT} :: Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it. You may
		      specify a default value and a completion table with
		      %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...}. The arrow keys access
		      prompt-specific history
      - %\N :: Insert the text entered at the Nth %^{PROMPT}, where N is a number starting
	       from 1.
      - %? :: After completing the template, position point here.

For specific link types, the following keywords are defined

       - a regular expression for occur searches
       For all other commands, this should be the empty string.
     - settings :: A list of option settings, similar to that in a let form, so like
		   this: ((opt1 val1) (opt2 val2) ...).   The values will be
		   evaluated at the moment of execution, so quote them when needed.
     - files :: A list of files to write the produced agenda buffer to with
		the command ‘org-store-agenda-views’.
		If a file name ends in ".html", an HTML version of the buffer
		is written out.  If it ends in ".ps", a postscript version is
		produced.  Otherwise, only the plain text is written to the file.

When using several characters as key to a command, the first characters
are prefix commands.  For the dispatcher to display useful information, you
should provide a description for the prefix, like

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" . "HOME + Name tag searches") ; describe prefix "h"
        ("hl" tags "+HOME+Lisa")
        ("hp" tags "+HOME+Peter")
        ("hk" tags "+HOME+Kim")))
#+END_SRC
**** Block agenda
     You can also define a set of commands, to create a composite agenda buffer.
     In this case, an entry looks like this:
   
     (key desc (cmd1 cmd2 ...) general-settings-for-whole-set files)

     where

     - desc :: A description string to be displayed in the dispatcher menu.
     - cmd :: An agenda command, similar to the above.  However, tree commands
              are not allowed, but instead you can get agenda and global todo list.

     key, settings, and files same as is described in previous section.

     So valid commands for a set are:
     - (agenda "" settings)
     - (alltodo "" settings)
     - (stuck "" settings)
     - (todo "match" settings files)
     - (search "match" settings files)
     - (tags "match" settings files)
     - (tags-todo "match" settings files)

Each command can carry a list of options, and another set of options can be
given for the whole set of commands.  Individual command options take
precedence over the general options.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
	  (tags-todo "home")
	  (tags "garden")))
	("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
	 ((agenda "")
	  (tags-todo "work")
	  (tags "office")))))
#+END_SRC
**** Setting options for custom commands
     Some settings:
     - (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
     - (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed; ")
     - (org-show-context-detail 'minimal)
     - (org-agenda-files '("~org/notes.org"))
     - (org-agenda-text-search-extra-files nil)
     - (ps-number-of-columns 2)
     - (ps-landscape-mode t)
     - (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
     - (org-agenda-remove-tags t)
     - (org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines 5)
     - (htmlize-output-type 'css)

     Don't know where to find all settings possibilities or their syntax.

     To control whether an agenda command should be accessible from a specific context, you
     can customize org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts. Let's say for example that you have
     an agenda command o displaying a view that you only need when reading emails. Then you
     would configure this option like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
      '(("o" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+END_SRC

     You can also tell that the command key o should refer to another command key r. In that
     case, add this command key like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
      '(("o" "r" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
        ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
	("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
	 ((agenda "")
	  (tags-todo "home")
	  (tags "garden"))
	 nil
	 ("~/views/home.html"))
	("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
	 ((agenda)
	  (tags-todo "work")
	  (tags "office"))
	 nil
	 ("~/views/office.ps" "~/calendars/office.ics"))))
